            <h1>Views and lifestyle</h1>
            <p>
              After re-establishing himself as an actor in the mid 1990s,
              Phoenix moved back to Los Angeles. He is known for his disdain of
              celebrity culture, rarely grant interviews and is reticent about
              his private life. In 2018, he described himself as a secular Jew
              who doesn’t affiliate with any organized religion; one of his
              "core values" is the idea of forgiveness. In early April 2005,
              Phoenix checked himself into rehab to be treated for alcoholism.
              Twelve years later, he revealed that he didn't need an
              intervention;"I really just thought of myself as a hedonist. I was
              an actor in L.A. I wanted to have a good time. But I wasn’t
              engaging with the world or myself in the way I wanted to". On
              January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in
              Hollywood, Phoenix veered off the road and flipped his car. The
              crash was reportedly caused by brake failure. Shaken and confused,
              he heard someone tapping on his window and telling him to "just
              relax". Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, "I'm fine. I am
              relaxed." The man replied, "No, you're not." The man then stopped
              Phoenix from lighting a cigarette while gasoline was leaking into
              the car cabin. Phoenix realized that the man was German filmmaker
              Werner Herzog. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by
              breaking the back window of the car, bystanders called an
              ambulance. Phoenix approached Herzog to express his gratitude. In
              2012, Phoenix labeled the Academy Awards "bullshit". He later gave
              an interview apologizing for his comments, and acknowledged that
              the awards provide an important platform for many deserving
              filmmakers. He elaborated on the topic while on Jimmy Kimmel Live!
              in 2015, explaining that he is uncomfortable receiving accolades
              for his work in films when he considers the filmmaking process to
              be a collaborative one. A longtime vegan, Phoenix finds animal
              agriculture "absurd and barbaric". He explained his reasoning
              behind his veganism; "To me, it just seems obvious – I don’t want
              to cause pain to another living empathetic creature. I don’t want
              to take its babies away from it, I don’t want to force it to be
              indoors and fattened up just to be slaughtered. Certainly, also,
              the effect that it has on our environment is devastating. So, for
              me, it’s my life and has always been my life, and it’s really one
              of the most important things to me."

          <h1>Relationships and family</h1>
          <p>
            In 1995, Phoenix started dating his Inventing the Abbotts co-star
            Liv Tyler, whom he dated till 1998. The two remain close friends to
            date, with Tyler considering Phoenix and his sisters as her family.
            He was romantically involved with South African model Topaz
            Page-Green from 2001 to 2005. Phoenix is currently on the board of
            directors for The Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organization which
            provides daily meals to students of township schools in Soweto,
            South Africa, founded by Page-Green. In 2012, Phoenix met Her
            co-star Rooney Mara. The two remained friends and began a romantic
            relationship four years later, during the making of Mary Magdalene.
            Their engagement was confirmed in July 2019 and the following year,
            the couple were reported to be expecting their first child together.
            In late September 2020, it was announced that the couple had a son,
            named River after Phoenix's late brother. They reside in the
            Hollywood Hills. Phoenix has described his family life as simple. He
            enjoys meditating, watching documentaries, reading scripts and
            taking karate classes. He has a black belt in karate
          </p>

          <h1>Animal rights activism</h1>
          <div class="aak">
            <p>
              Phoenix is viewed as one of the most active celebrities in the
              animal rights movement. A vegan since age three, he does not wear
              any clothes made out of animal skin; he requests that all of his
              leather costumes in films are made from synthetic materials.
              Phoenix has said that animal rights are one of the most important
              pillars in his life, and maintains that "climate change is
              imminent if we do not adopt a plant-based lifestyle". He has
              helped raising awareness of the correlation between animal rights,
              climate change and health issues. Phoenix has received praise and
              accolades from animal rights groups, with PETA naming him "Person
              of the Year" in 2019.

          <p>
            PETA's president, Ingrid Newkirk said in a statement: "Joaquin
            Phoenix never misses an opportunity to turn the spotlight away from
            himself and onto animals’ plight and to set a great example of
            walking the vegan walk". He has been an active supporter of numerous
            animal rights organizations, including PETA.Throughout the years,
            Phoenix has headlined numerous campagins for different organizations
            to help promote veganism and end animal slaughter. In 2019, Phoenix
            and his partner Rooney Mara led the National Animal Rights Day
            demonstration to help spread awareness for animal rights. On January
            10, 2020, Phoenix was arrested with actress Jane Fonda at a climate
            change protest outside the United States Capitol at Washington, D.C.
            At the protest, Phoenix spoke about the link between animal
            agriculture and climate change.
